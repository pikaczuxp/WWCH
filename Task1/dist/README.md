#Weekly Webdev Challange -  1
--------------------------------

This is my own solution to **Weekly Webdev Challange** (**challange 1**). More information you can find either on [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923/) or on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw2hu70L5Ye_VkhvdDZhN3haSlE.In near future I will try to do all tasks and publish my solutions for them. It'd be great to hear a comment about this code from you.

###Description


To prepare environment to develop this task I used [frontend-starter](https://github.com/implico/frontend-starter) framework. In my opinion it is a great tool to build apps rapidly. This tool has a logical folder structure, gulp task runner to automate a job and it is fully customizable. With this tool I can only focus on “to-do” tasks. If you would like to try this tool yourself, please visit a link above and there you will find an instruction how to use it.

For review purpose all codes are compiled but not compressed and they are placed on **dist** folder.

Solution is published [**here**](https://wooqash.github.io/WWCH/Task1/dist/) .

 To prepare this solutions I used:

 - pure HTML,  
 - sass files compailed to css, 
 - pure vanila JS in ES6 notation transpiled to es5,

I created this template as a RWD solution with pixel perfect, mobile first approach and with accessibility elements like special HTML attributes. For accessibility reason I also created a special JS modules to handle dropdown (*you can open a location dropdown control and select location using only a keyboard - Enter/Space for Open/Select dropdown, arrow keys for choosing options*) and checkbox (*you can check checkbox using keybord - Enter/Space for Select/Unselect*) elements by keyboard.
